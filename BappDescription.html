<p>This is a Burpsuite plugin for importing directory bruteforcing results into Burp for futher analysis.
    This is an alternative to proxying bruteforcing tools through Burp to catch the results.</p>

<p>Supported tools:</p>

<ul>
    <li>GoBuster</li>
    <li>DirSearch</li>
</ul>

<p>It is modularized for easily adding parsing of different bruteforcing tools.
To create a new parser make a new class that extends BaseParser and implement the parseDirectory method.
    This takes a line from the bruteforce tool output file and returns a URL for burpsuite to use.</p>
